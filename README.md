# Retail Sales Prediction

## Overview

This project focuses on building a predictive model to forecast retail sales using historical sales data. Accurate sales forecasting helps businesses optimize inventory, improve supply chain management, and increase profitability.

The repository contains data preprocessing steps, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment-ready scripts for retail sales prediction.

---

## Features

* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
* Feature engineering for enhanced predictive power
* Multiple machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
* Model evaluation metrics (RMSE, MAE, R²)
* Jupyter notebooks for step-by-step analysis
* Scripts for training and predicting sales on new data

---

## Dataset

The dataset includes historical sales data with features such as:

* Store ID
* Date
* Product category
* Promotions
* Holidays
* Sales volume

*Note: Dataset should be placed in the `/data` folder (not included in the repo due to size/privacy).*

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/retail-sales-prediction.git
   cd retail-sales-prediction
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Usage

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis

Run the Jupyter notebook for EDA to understand data distribution and relationships:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/eda_retail_sales.ipynb
```

### 2. Train the Model

Run the training script to train the prediction model:

```bash
python scripts/train_model.py --data_path data/retail_sales.csv
```

### 3. Predict Sales

Use the trained model to make predictions on new data:

```bash
python scripts/predict_sales.py --input_path data/new_data.csv --output_path results/predictions.csv
```
